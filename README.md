# Tutorial in ISBI 2023: Topological Data Analysis for Biomedical Imaging Data


### Lecture 1. Simplical homology and persistent homology
The tutorial will be given by Moo K. Chung with the help of Zijian Chen. The tutorial will cover the basics of topological data analysis (TDA) such as Rips and graph filtrations, boundary operators, the Hodge Laplacian. Then the concept of persistent diagrams and barcodes will be introduced. How to resampling scatter points in the persistent diagram using the Dirichlet distribution will be explained. 

### Lecture 2. Wasserstein distance between persistent diagrams
The tutorial will be given by Soheil Kolouri. The tutorial consists of introduction to Wasserstein distances and its sliced version, which does scalable computation of the Wasserstein distance. Persistent diagrams will be represented as an empirical distributions using the Dirac delta functions. Then  the algorithmic detail on the computation of  the Wasserstein distance between persistent diagrams will be presented. Its scalable version called the sliced-Wasserstein distance will be also introduced. Various machine learning applications including deep learning will be presented.  In deep leaning, mainly the sliced-Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function.

### Lecture 3. Dynamic topological data analysis
The tutorial will be given by Hernando Ombao. The tutorial consists of the concept of time series and its topological embedding. 
The time delay embedding and slide window embedding that embed time series data into scatter points will be explained. 
Then graph consistint of the scatter points will be used to build time varying persistent diagrams or other topological features. 
The dependency structures of data will then be modeled through persistent homology. The topological dependency of dynamic imaging data has been rarely investigated but the direction of TDA is moving toward modeling the topology of dynamics or the dynamics of topological changes in functional imaging such as MEG, EEG, fMRI and fNIR.
